# Sebastian

A replacement for Conky.

## What?

Conky is the greatest system monitor display panel
thingie in the entire universe... except when it's
not. After several years of usage, I'm frustrated
by:

- Syntax quirks
- Behaviour quirks
- Transparency weirdness
- Sometimes "colour" is spelled "color" depending on the config option
- I'm not sure if it's hardware-accelerated but I don't think so
- Windows/Mac/Wayland support eeeh
- The lack of an actual alternative (everything else reminds me of Vista widgets and/or pre-1999 graphics)
- Conditionals
- Can I haz asynchronous things
- Moar fonts!
- Better support for adventurous ideas (like, pie charts are the ultimate in conky awesomeness. Pie charts.)
- Lua

## Uhhh

Sebastian will (eventually) have:

- Solutions to all of the above:
  + Consistent syntax/grammar
  + OpenGL
  + Windows/Mac/Wayland/X11
  + Full expressive power (conditionals, loops, recursion...)
  + Async magic rainbows
  + Ruby!
- An API
- Support for gems (with Bundler)
- Interactivity (being able to click things)
- Conkyrc converter (maybe!)
- Access to the underlying (raw) graphics layer
- Conky-style default widgets
- Better theming?

## W-When

As soon as I get round to it.
